# activity_15
This is a repo for Activity 15 that practices using GitHub with quarto file from 
Activity 14 for the class Stat 184, Fall 2025. This will give me practice working 
with commits and pulls and practice version control.

There is no data directly associated with this repo but the data found in 
Activity 14 is the Armed Forces Data:
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19xQnI1cBh6Jkw7eP8YQuuicMlVDF7Gr-nXCb5qbwb_E/edit?usp=sharing
-https://neilhatfield.github.io/Stat184_PayGradeRanks.html
And the Bady names data from the DC data package. 

## Current Plan
Within this repo, the following will be carried out:
1. Creating the repo
2. Making multiple branches
3. Making and resolving issues
4. Proper commits and pull requests
5. A pdf and qmd of Activity 14 uploaded

## Repo Organization
This repo will be a simple organizational structure. All files will be found in 
the top level and without any sub-folders.
